Hello 
This is a Web-Tech assignment where one  can view various phone brands 
and also display specs of select phones in a table format.

Done differently , instead of having a database for processing search bar
forms ,we have used the concept of HTML-5 LocalStorage to display specs of phones 

The possible phones that you can search in the search box :

-samsung a8
-samsung e7
-samsung j7
-samsung s6
-sony z5
-sony z4
-sony t3
-moto droidturbo
-moto xplay"
-moto xstyle
-iphone 6s
-sony e4
-iphone 5s
